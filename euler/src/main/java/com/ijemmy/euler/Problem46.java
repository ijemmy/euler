/**
 * We will iterate through all odd number until we find the number that break Goldbach's conjecture
 * For each number, we will
 * 1. Check that it is not a prime number (must be composite)
 * 2. Iterate through a list of prime numbers with smaller value than the current number
 * 2.1 Subtract the number with the prime number and divide by 2
 * 2.2 Determine if this number is a square root of another integer
 * 
 * Note: There is a faster way to determine if an integer is a square of another integer
 * The discussion can be found here
